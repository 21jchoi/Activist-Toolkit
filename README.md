# Activist Toolkit Project

This is a place for you to start building your personal project in week 2.

## Project Requirements
You will:
- Build a multipage website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Include a top navigation bar.
- Use CSS and background image properties to create a parallax scroll effect on the homepage of your website.
- Use the DOM, functions, event listeners, and JavaScript events to create an action item checklist.
- Use flexbox and media rules to create a responsive website.
- Customize the look and feel of your site through colors, images, and  fonts using CSS. 
- Use comments to describe your code.



## Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Customizing the CSS of your site. 
- Adding accessibility features to your website. 
- Adding a resources page where your audience can get more information. 
- Adding social media buttons so your audience can spread the word. 
- Adding additional media like videos, audio, image galleries, etc. to enhance your message.
- Make it responsive using @media rules.
- Adding user input so your audience can add their own action items. 


# Starter Code File Overview
Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html
This is your homepage where you will add the parallax scrolling effect. It has some starter code with placeholders for images, a title, intro text, and text descriptions.

## ← about.html
This will be your about page where you add information about yourself.

## ← take-action.html
This will hold your action item checklist and action description.

## ← script.js
This is where you will write the JavaScript to check off and delete items on your list. 

## ← styles.css
This CSS file is contains the CSS rule sets for index.html, any universal elements
for all pages, and the media rules for responsive design. We've already included a lot of
them for you, but you should customize it as you want. 

Since there is a lot of CSS rule sets for this project, we broke out the ones that 
are page specific in to separate files. You can attach multiple CSS files to a single HTML 
file, so this allows us to stay organized.

## ← about.css
This CSS file contains the CSS rule set for about.html. 

## ← take-action.css
This CSS file contains the CSS rule set for take-action.html.
